# export-bsv-script

Export Bible Story Video Script (in docx format) to files needed by the Story Producer App.
Files will be created in a directory based on the title (command-line argument).

Add a Row to the table with "T" as the # and the Title in the "Narration Text" column instead of specifying the title on the command-line.

# export-xml-script

Create an XML file (project.xml) from the template directory generated by the export-bsv-script to be used by Story Producer.

Notes about what the XML script expects:
* The template folder has already been created at matches the name provided in the docx
* Image files must exist or they will not be added to the XML
* The end time must exist, the start time is optional
* The mp4 file must exist or it will not be added to the XML
* Make sure that the narration files are named "narration0.wav or mp3" with the respective page number
* Make sure that the image files are named "0.jpg or png" with the respective page number
* Currently, useMillis is always false

## Windows Executable
Download a release and drag-drop a file on the executable.  It will create a directory (name is the title) with the files in it.

## Command-Line

```
ruby export-bsv-script.rb [-t "Title"] filename.docx
